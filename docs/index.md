####Arya-XAI - Translating ‘black box DL models’ into interpretable & trustable models
Arya-XAI enhances & explains your DL model predictions, by generating new and simple interpretable explanations in real time as required by various stakeholders. 

Current approaches to explain black box DL models are heavily reliant on specific data types and network components which severely limits their applicability on diverse use-cases and novel network architectures. This poses challenges to understand or explain true-to-model functioning. Arya-Xai  decodes this ‘true-to-model’ feature weightage along with node level weightages for any neural network. 

The framework not only improves interpretability of DL models substantially, but also offers easy to understand reasons behind the outcome
